Data Sources:

Utilize the SEO Handler Node with the seo_extract_page_content_* function, executing it three distinct times:

First call with seo_extract_page_content_1 for "Competitor 1".
Second call with seo_extract_page_content_2 for "Competitor 2".
Third call with seo_extract_page_content_3 for "Competitor 3".


Input: URLs fetched from Google Sheet via the read_google_sheet_1756661106_79 function, extracting the columns "Competitor 1", "Competitor 2", and "Competitor 3" for processing in subsequent steps.
Output: JSON for each call containing title, meta_description, H1, H2, H3, H4, main_content, keyword density analysis, and schema.

Step-by-Step Logic:

Page Extraction Phase:

For each URL from the Google Sheet, perform the corresponding seo_extract_page_content_* call to retrieve: title, meta_description, H1, H2, H3 from main content sections, bold/highlighted keywords (e.g., , , or emphasized text) with ≥50% of the specified keyword words, and content length (word count of main_content).
Exclude H4 and below unless they contain the specified keyword; ensure a clean extraction of main_content (excluding headers, footers, sidebars).
Compute basic keyword density for the specified keyword in main_content (occurrences divided by total words).


Keyword Cloud Creation Phase:

Collect recurring terms from all competitors' H2s, H3s, and bolded/highlighted words, prioritizing phrases related to the specified keyword or semantically similar terms.
Rank terms by frequency across all analyzed pages (counting occurrences, ignoring duplicates within a single page).
Generate a keyword cloud list of the top 5-10 terms (depending on data volume), sorted by descending frequency.
Include only relevant, non-generic terms (e.g., exclude stop words like "the", "and").



Output Formatting:

Structure output as a tabular data table with the following columns: Keyword, Competitor URL, Title, Meta Description, H1, H2s, H3s, Content Length, Repeated Keywords, Keyword Density, Keyword Cloud.
Use one row per competitor plus a header row.
If fewer than 3 URLs are provided, include an error message in the first row under "Competitor URL" ("Insufficient competitors provided (need at least 3)") and leave other columns empty.

Rules/Constraints:

Require at least 3 URLs as input from the Google Sheet; trigger an error message if fewer are detected.
Filter bolded keywords to include only those with ≥50% of the keyword's words.
Ensure content length accurately reflects the word count of main_content.
Output only tabular data (no free text explanations outside the table).

Data Writing/Updating:

After generating the tabular output, use the write_google_sheet_1756661900_80 function with range Sheet1!A:K to save the result, populating the Google Sheet with the following column structure:
| Keyword | Competitor URL | Title | Meta Description | H1 | H2s | H3s | Content Length | Repeated Keywords | Keyword Density | Keyword Cloud |
