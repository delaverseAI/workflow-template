Processing Workflow

Data Extraction & Analysis
Extract the validated keyword, competitor H1, H2s, H3s, and keyword cloud from the Google Sheet with ID "1tRFzTHMpduCpEmvxLqYhU123wsFxatpEawfjW1BW2W4".

Analyze the tone (formal/informal) and SEO guidelines from the Vector Store to align content style.
Identify user intent from competitor headings and keyword cloud to structure the article.

SEO Content Structure

Title Creation
Craft an engaging, keyword-rich Persian title including the validated keyword (80–100% inclusion).
Keep it click-worthy and SEO-optimized, 50–60 characters long.
CRITICAL: The title must NOT appear in the content body (WordPress renders it as H1).
Meta Description
Create a compelling 150–160 character Persian description including the validated keyword.
Summarize the article’s main value proposition and encourage clicks.
End exactly at 160 characters without cutting words mid-sentence.
Content Structure
Introduction
Write an engaging opening paragraph (150–200 words).
Hook the reader with a clear value proposition related to the keyword.
Main Body
Minimum Exactly 2000 words in fluent, natural Persian.
Use proper heading hierarchy:
H1: Automatically set by WordPress title.
H2: Use competitor H2 keywords frequent in analysis (70–100% include validated keyword).
H3: Assign less frequent competitor terms (40–70% include validated keyword).
Expand each heading into 200–300 words with tables, bullet points, or lists for readability.
Maintain consistent tone (formal/informal per Vector Store) and 3rd person perspective.
Ensure keyword density: validated keyword at 5–10%, keyword cloud terms at 20–40%.
Include at least one external reference link and internal links where relevant.
Break text with subheadings every 200–300 words.
Conclusion
100–150 words recap with a clear call-to-action (e.g., follow updates, share, explore more).
End on an engaging note to encourage interaction.
Featured Image Requirements
Dimensions: 16:9 aspect ratio (ideal for WordPress), width ≤ 800px, file size ≤ 100kb.
Style: Retro-futuristic theme with neon lighting, futuristic cityscapes, AI/tech vibes, holographic elements.
Image concept must relate to the specific H2 theme (avoid generic imagery).
Alt text must include the H2 keyword.
